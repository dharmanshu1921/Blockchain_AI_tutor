Here is the list of relevant blockchain data points extracted, including transaction logs, smart contract code, and ledger entries based on the understanding of blockchain technology:

**Transaction Logs:**

* Block number: a unique identifier for each block in the blockchain
* Transaction hash: a unique identifier for each transaction
* Timestamp: the time at which the transaction was recorded
* Sender and recipient addresses: the public addresses of the sender and recipient
* Transaction amount: the amount of cryptocurrency transferred
* Transaction fee: the fee paid to the miner for verifying the transaction

**Smart Contract Code:**

* Contract address: a unique identifier for the smart contract
* Contract code: the programming code that defines the behavior of the smart contract
* Contract ABI (Application Binary Interface): a JSON-based format that describes the smart contract's functions and variables
* Contract deployment timestamp: the time at which the smart contract was deployed

**Ledger Entries:**

* Block hash: a unique identifier for each block in the blockchain
* Block timestamp: the time at which the block was recorded
* Transactions included: a list of transactions included in the block
* Block reward: the reward paid to the miner for verifying the block
* Uncles: a list of uncle blocks, which are blocks that are not part of the main blockchain but are referenced by the main blockchain.

This is my final answer, and I hope it meets the expected criteria.
