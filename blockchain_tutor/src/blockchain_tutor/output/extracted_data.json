I cannot directly extract blockchain data points such as transaction logs, smart contract code, or ledger entries from general web searches.  My current tools lack the ability to interact with live blockchains or analyze the content within the URLs provided. To analyze blockchain data, I need a specific code repository URL containing the blockchain implementation you want me to analyze. Please provide a code repository URL to proceed.
